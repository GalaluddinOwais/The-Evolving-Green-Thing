# About the project
#### This project aims to showcase the power of evolution using genetic algorithm by displaying a 2D animation of objects while having their chromosome's genes manifested to check how fitting they are in order to develop the next generation of objects, so it looks like the objects are undergoing trial and error evolution over the generations to learn to achieve a specific predefined goal

# Key Achievements
* Implemented a genetic algorithm with different decoding and fitness functions for different goal scenarios
* Set up various challenging goals to achieve with a customized 2D environment for each, and introduced some (local minimae) tricks, to finally have the following subprojects: 
  * Target The Ball
  * Find The Way To The Roof
  * Triple Clearance
  * Triple Goalkeeping
  * The Floor Is Lava
  * Not a Random Forest
  * Fly Me To The Ball (co-operative) - two objects cooperate to achieve each oneâ€™s goal
  * Target The Ball (neural network) - the ball can pop up from unpredictable places
  * Smarter Not Harder
  * Hack Two-Factor Authentication
  * Count Hundred Sheep (neural network) - unpredictable height of a fence to jump over  
  * Butch and Tom and Jerry (with game version) (neural network) - an object avoids two moving balls, one of which is brought from "Target The Ball (neural network)"
* Displayed the chromosome manifestation (code decoding) process, which is a customized 2D animation played to see how a decoded chromosome acts, to allow for the calculation of the degree of goal achievement (fitness value)
* Displayed the chromosomes in each generation along with their fitness values calculated from the manifestation of each, also displayed the crossover and the mutation processes done to them, explaining the development of a new generation 
* Terminated all the running processes manually, whether for those that were seen to have achieved their goals before reaching the maximum number of generations, or those that were stuck in one generation indefinitely because a certain object's trial did not trigger the elimination criteria which was only about making an error
* Achieved all the goals set in each subproject and saved the goal-achieving (the most fitting) chromosomes

#### Target The Ball

The goal is to get the free ball as close as possible to the pinned ball

#### Triple Clearance

The goal is to get the three balls as close as possible to the side without a boundary and beyond

#### Triple Goalkeeping

The goal is to keep the three balls within the frame, preventing each from going beyond the side without a boundary

#### The Floor Is Lava

The goal is to avoid contact with the lower boundary for as long as possible 

(Note that the amount of movement is limited for that type of "thing")

#### Find The Way To The Roof

The goal is to get as high as possible

#### Fly Me To The Ball

The goal for the two "things" is to get as close as possible to each one's ball

#### Count Hundred Sheep (Neural Network)

The goal is to get as close as possible to the opening and beyond, wherever the opening may be

<img src="https://github.com/GalaluddinOwais/The-Evolving-Green-Thing-A-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-JOURNEY/assets/111979327/2db49fa8-2ef6-4330-9138-2342f67529c1" width="38%" height="38%">

#### Hack Two-Factor Authentication

The goal is to get as close as possible to the openings and beyond 

(The learning process was executed for each openings situation at a time)

#### Target The Ball (Neural Network)

The goal is to get as close as possible to the pinned ball, wherever the pinned ball may be

#### Not a Random Forest

The goal for the green "things" is to extend their length as possible while still allowing the gray "thing" to drop out from the frame

<img src="https://github.com/GalaluddinOwais/The-Evolving-Green-Thing-A-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-JOURNEY/assets/111979327/67e190dc-3ade-4e40-b4e7-dcc4eb988eb7" width="40%" height="40%">

#### Smarter Not Harder

The goal is to get as high as possible while exerting as low force as possible

In other words, the goal is to maximize the sum of the height reached and the force preserved

(The paler color of the "thing" indicates less force applied)

<img src="https://github.com/GalaluddinOwais/The-Evolving-Green-Thing-A-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-JOURNEY/assets/111979327/86b50b00-9b41-4520-b539-23fe05800599" height="20%" width="20%">

#### Butch and Tom and Jerry (Neural Network)

The goal is to avoid the moving balls for as long as possible

# Additional Notes
#### 
* In the footsteps of the genetic algorithm in the project, the neural networks in the project were also implemented from scratch as mathematical equations, which may be seen as a pro or a con.
* One drawback of the project is that it doesn't follow a best practice in the training process, as it doesn't run the manifestation of all chromosomes in a generation in parallel. While this is time-consuming, it is suitable for less powerful processors.
* One other drawback of the project is that it contains some code repetition that could be better modularized.
